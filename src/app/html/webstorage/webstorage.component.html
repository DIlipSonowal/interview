       <p>Web storage provides the facility to store the data of our web applications locally into the userâ€™s browser. It can store up to 10 MB data. Web storage helps to increase the performance of our applications.</p>
       <p>There are two types of web storage that are used to store data locally in HTML5:
       </p>
       <p><b>Local storage:</b> This stores the data that will not expire or clear automatically when a user closes or reopens a browser.</p>

       <p><b>Session Storage:</b> This stores data for one session only(i.e, a user who is surfing the internet or website). Once the browser is closed, session data will automatically delete from the web browse</p>
