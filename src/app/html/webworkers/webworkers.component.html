       <p>
            A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
                Web Workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads. The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface. In addition, they can perform I/O using XMLHttpRequest (although the responseXML and channel attributes are always null). Once created, a worker can send messages to the JavaScript code that created it by posting messages to an event handler specified by that code (and vice versa). This article provides a detailed introduction to using web workers.
            </p>

          <p>  When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.</p>

          <p>  A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.</p>

<pre>if (typeof(Worker) !== "undefined") {{'{'}}
  // Yes! Web worker support!
  // Some code.....
{{'}'}} else {{'{'}}
  // Sorry! No Web Worker support..
{{'}'}}          
</pre>       
<b>Create a Web Worker File</b>
<p>Now, let's create our web worker in an external JavaScript.</p>

<p>Here, we create a script that counts. The script is stored in the "demo_workers.js" file:</p>
<pre>
var i = 0;

function timedCount() {{'{'}}
  i = i + 1;
  postMessage(i);
  setTimeout("timedCount()",500);
{{'}'}}

timedCount();        
</pre> 
The important part of the code above is the postMessage() method - which is used to post a message back to the HTML page.
<pre>
        if (typeof(w) == "undefined") {{'{'}}
            w = new Worker("demo_workers.js");
        {{'}'}}
</pre>

<b>Create a Web Worker Object</b><br/>
<p>Now that we have the web worker file, we need to call it from an HTML page.</p>
<p>
The following lines checks if the worker already exists, if not - it creates a new web worker object and runs the code in "demo_workers.js":
</p>
<pre>
if (typeof(w) == "undefined") {{'{'}}
  w = new Worker("demo_workers.js");
{{'}'}}
Then we can send and receive messages from the web worker.

Add an "onmessage" event listener to the web worker.

w.onmessage = function(event){{'{'}}
  document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = event.data;
{{'}'}};</pre>
<p>When the web worker posts a message, the code within the event listener is executed. The data from the web worker is stored in event.data.</p>

Terminate a Web Worker<br/>
When a web worker object is created, it will continue to listen for messages (even after the external script is finished) until it is terminated.
<br/>
To terminate a web worker, and free browser/computer resources, use the terminate() method:
<br/>
<b>w.terminate();</b><br/><br/>
Reuse the Web Worker<br/>
If you set the worker variable to undefined, after it has been terminated, you can reuse the code:
<br/>
w = undefined;
