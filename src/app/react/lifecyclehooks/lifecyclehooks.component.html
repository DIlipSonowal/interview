         <b>ComponentWillMount : </b> This function is invoked right before the component is mounted on the DOM i.e. this function gets invoked once before the render() function is executed for the first time.

        <p>
            <b>ComponentDidMount : </b> This function is invoked right after the component is mounted on the DOM i.e. this function gets invoked once after the render() function is executed for the first time.

            <b>ComponentWillReceiveProps : </b> This is a Props exclusive Function and is independent of States. This function is invoked before a mounted component gets its props reassigned. The function is passed the new set of Props which may or may not be identical to the original Props. Thus checking is a mandatory step in this regards. The following code snippet shows a sample use-case.
  </p>
  <pre>
componentWillRecieveProps(newProps) 
{{'{'}} 
    if (this.props !== newProps) {{'{'}}
        console.log(" New Props have been assigned "); 
        // Use this.setState() to rerender the page. 
    {{'}'}} 
{{'}'}}
</pre>

            <b>shouldComponentUpdate : </b> By default, every state or props update re-render the page but this may not always be the desired outcome, sometimes it is desired that on updating the page will not be repainted. The shouldComponentUpdate() Function fulfills the requirement by letting React know whether the component’s output will be affected by the update or not. shouldComponentUpdate() is invoked before rendering an already mounted component when new props or state are being received. If returned false then the subsequent steps of rendering will not be carried out. This function can’t be used in case of forceUpdate(). The Function takes the new Props and new State as the arguments and returns whether to re-render or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>componentWillUpdate : </b> this function is invoked before the component is rerendered i.e. this function gets invoked once before the render() function is executed after the updation of State or Props.
        </p>  
        <p>
            <b>componentDidUpdate : </b> Similarly this function is invoked after the component is rerendered i.e. this function gets invoked once after the render() function is executed after the updation of State or Props.
        </p>  

        <p>
            <b>componentWillUnmount : </b> This function is invoked before the component is finally unmounted from the DOM i.e. this function gets invoked once before the component is removed from the page and this denotes the end of the lifecycle.
        </p>
