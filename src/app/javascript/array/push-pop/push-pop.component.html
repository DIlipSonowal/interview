<h1>Push() / Pop()</h1>
The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array.
<pre>
    const plants = ['broccoli', 'cauliflower', 'cabbage', 'kale', 'tomato'];

    console.log(plants.pop());
    // expected output: "tomato"
    
    console.log(plants);
    // expected output: Array ["broccoli", "cauliflower", "cabbage", "kale"]
    
    plants.pop();
    
    console.log(plants);
    // expected output: Array ["broccoli", "cauliflower", "cabbage"]
</pre>    
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre>arr.pop()</pre>
<p>The removed element from the array; undefined if the array is empty.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">The pop method removes the last element from an array and returns that value to the caller.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">pop is intentionally generic; this method can be called or applied to objects resembling arrays. Objects which do not contain a length property reflecting the last in a series of consecutive, zero-based numerical properties may not behave in any meaningful manner.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">If you call pop() on an empty array, it returns undefined.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 7px;">Array.prototype.shift() has similar behavior to pop, but applied to the first element in an array.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using apply( ) or call ( ) on array-like objects</h3>
The following code creates the myFish array-like object containing four elements and a length parameter, then removes its last element and decrements the length parameter.
<pre>
    var myFish = {{'{'}}0:'angel', 1:'clown', 2:'mandarin', 3:'sturgeon', length: 4{{'}'}};

    var popped = Array.prototype.pop.call(myFish); //same syntax for using apply( )
    
    console.log(myFish); // {{'{'}}0:'angel', 1:'clown', 2:'mandarin', length: 3{{'}'}}
    
    console.log(popped); // 'sturgeon'
</pre>    

***************************************
<h3>Push()</h3>
The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
<pre>
    const animals = ['pigs', 'goats', 'sheep'];

    const count = animals.push('cows');
    console.log(count);
    // expected output: 4
    console.log(animals);
    // expected output: Array ["pigs", "goats", "sheep", "cows"]
    
    animals.push('chickens', 'cats', 'dogs');
    console.log(animals);
    // expected output: Array ["pigs", "goats", "sheep", "cows", "chickens", "cats", "dogs"]
</pre>    
<h4>Syntax</h4>
<pre>arr.push(element1[, ...[, elementN]])</pre>

<h3>elementN</h3>
The element(s) to add to the end of the array.
<h3>Return Value</h3>
The new length property of the object upon which the method was called.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The push method appends values to an array.</p>

<p>push is intentionally generic. This method can be used with call() or apply() on objects resembling arrays. The push method relies on a length property to determine where to start inserting the given values. If the length property cannot be converted into a number, the index used is 0. This includes the possibility of length being nonexistent, in which case length will also be created.</p>

<p>Although strings are native, Array-like objects, they are not suitable in applications of this method, as strings are immutable.  Similarly for the native, Array-like object arguments.</p>

<h4>Merging two arrays</h4>
<p>This example uses apply() to push all elements from a second array.</p>

<p>Do not use this method if the second array (moreVegs in the example) is very large, because the maximum number of parameters that one function can take is limited in practice. See apply() for more details.</p>
<pre>
    let vegetables = ['parsnip', 'potato']
    let moreVegs = ['celery', 'beetroot']
    
    // Merge the second array into the first one
    // Equivalent to vegetables.push('celery', 'beetroot')
    Array.prototype.push.apply(vegetables, moreVegs)
    
    console.log(vegetables)  // ['parsnip', 'potato', 'celery', 'beetroot']
</pre>    
<h4>Using an object in an array-like fashion</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, push is intentionally generic, and we can use that to our advantage. Array.prototype.push can work on an object just fine, as this example shows.</p>

<p>Note that we don't create an array to store a collection of objects. Instead, we store the collection on the object itself and use call on Array.prototype.push to trick the method into thinking we are dealing with an array—and it just works, thanks to the way JavaScript allows us to establish the execution context however we please.</p>

<pre>
let obj = {{'{'}}
    length: 0,

    addElem: function addElem(elem) {{'{'}}
        // obj.length is automatically incremented 
        // every time an element is added.
        [].push.call(this, elem)
    {{'}'}}
{{'}'}}

// Let's add some empty objects just to illustrate.
obj.addElem({{'{'}}{{'}'}})
obj.addElem({{'{'}}{{'}'}})
console.log(obj.length)
// → 2
</pre>    
Note that although obj is not an array, the method push successfully incremented obj's length property just like if we were dealing with an actual array.
