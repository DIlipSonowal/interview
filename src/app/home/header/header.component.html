<ul>
    <li>
        git config: This sets the configuration values for your username, email, gpg key, preferred diff algorithm, file formats and more:
        <br/>
        git config –global user.name "Your Username Here"<br/>
        git config –global user.email "user@domain.com"
    </li>
    <li>Git init : git init [repository name]<br/>This command is used to start a new repository.<br/>
        This initializes a git repository, and creates the initial .git directory in a new or already existing project:
    </li>
    <li>
            git clone: This command creates a Git repository copy from a remote source. The command will also add the original location as a remote location so you are able to fetch from it again and push to it if you have permissions:
            <br/>git clone git@github.com:user/test.git
    </li>
    <li>
            git add: This will add file changes that are in your working directory to your stage/index:<br/> git add [file name], OR git add * (for all)
    </li>

    <li>
            git rm: This will remove files from your index and your working directory so they will not be tracked:<br>
            git rm [file_name]
    </li>
    <li>
            git commit: This Git command takes all of the changes written in the index, creates a new commit object pointing to it, and sets the branch to point to that new commit:<br/>
            git commit -m 'committing added changes'<br/>
            git commit -a -m 'committing all changes, equals to git add and git commit'
    </li>
    <li>
            git status: This Git command shows the status of files in the index versus the working directory. It will list out files that are untracked (only in your working directory), modified (tracked but not yet updated in your index), and staged (added to your index and ready for committing):<br/>
            git status
    </li>
    <li>
            git branch: This lists existing branches, including remote branches if ‘-a’ is provided. It will create a new branch if a branch name is provided:
    </li>
    <li>
        git checkout: Switch to different branches<br/>
        How to : git checkout &lt;branch&gt; or git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; if you want to create and switch to a new branch.
    </li>

    <li>
            git stash: Save changes that you don’t want to commit immediately.<br/>
            git stash in your working directory. git stash apply if you want to bring your saved changes back
    </li>

    <li>
            git merge: Merge two branches you were working on.<br/>
            Switch to branch you want to merge everything in. git merge [branch_you_want_to_merge]
    </li>
    <li>
            git reset: You know when you commit changes that are not complete, this sets your index to the latest commit that you want to work on with.<br/>
            git reset [mode] [COMMIT] <br/>
            This command will reset your index and working directory to the state of your last commit. Effectively taking you back:<br/>
            git reset –hard HEAD
    </li>
    <li>
            git tag: This Git command tags a specific commit with a simple, human readable handle that never moves:<br/>
            git tag -a v2.0 -m ‘this is version 2.0 tag’
    </li>

    <li>
            git pull: This will fetch all the files from the remote repository and merge them with your local one:<br/>
            git pull origin
    </li>
    <li>
            git push: This Git command will push all the modified local objects to the remote repository and advances its branches:<br/>
            git push origin master
    </li>
    <li>
