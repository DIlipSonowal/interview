<p><b>Observable</b></p>
<p>Observables are lazy Push collections of multiple values. They fill the missing spot in the following table:</p>
<pre>
        SINGLE      MULTIPLE
Pull	Function    Iterator
Push	Promise     Observable
</pre>
<p>Example. The following is an Observable that pushes the values 1, 2, 3 immediately (synchronously) when subscribed, and the value 4 after one second has passed since the subscribe call, then completes:</p>
<pre>
import {{'{'}} Observable {{'}'}} from 'rxjs';

const observable = new Observable(subscriber => {{'{'}}
    subscriber.next(1);
    subscriber.next(2);
    subscriber.next(3);
    setTimeout(() => {{'{'}}
        subscriber.next(4);
        subscriber.complete();
    {{'}'}}, 1000);
{{'}'}});
</pre>
<p>To invoke the Observable and see these values, we need to subscribe to it:</p>
<pre>
console.log('just before subscribe');
observable.subscribe({{'{'}}
    next(x) {{'{'}} console.log('got value ' + x); {{'}'}},
    error(err) {{'{'}} console.error('something wrong occurred: ' + err); {{'}'}},
    complete() {{'{'}} console.log('done'); {{'}'}}
{{'}'}});
console.log('just after subscribe');    
</pre>

<p><b>Observables as generalizations of functions</b></p>
<p>Contrary to popular claims, Observables are not like EventEmitters nor are they like Promises for multiple values. Observables may act like EventEmitters in some cases, namely when they are multicasted using RxJS Subjects, but usually they don't act like EventEmitters.</p>
<p class="infoClass">Observables are like functions with zero arguments, but generalize those to allow multiple values.</p>
<pre>
function foo() {{'{'}}
    console.log('Hello');
    return 42;
{{'}'}}
const x = foo.call(); // same as foo()
console.log(x);
const y = foo.call(); // same as foo()
console.log(y);
---------------------------->
output :
"Hello"
42
"Hello"
42
</pre>
<p>You can write the same behavior above, but with Observables:</p>
<pre>
import {{'{'}} Observable {{'}'}} from 'rxjs';

const foo = new Observable(subscriber => {{'{'}}
    console.log('Hello');
    subscriber.next(42);
{{'}'}});
        
foo.subscribe(x => {{'{'}}
    console.log(x);
{{'}'}});
foo.subscribe(y => {{'{'}}
    console.log(y);
{{'}'}});
</pre>            
<p>This happens because both functions and Observables are lazy computations. If you don't call the function, the console.log('Hello') won't happen. Also with Observables, if you don't "call" it (with subscribe), the console.log('Hello') won't happen. Plus, "calling" or "subscribing" is an isolated operation: two function calls trigger two separate side effects, and two Observable subscribes trigger two separate side effects. As opposed to EventEmitters which share the side effects and have eager execution regardless of the existence of subscribers, Observables have no shared execution and are lazy.</p>
<p class="infoClass">Subscribing to an Observable is analogous to calling a Function.</p>
<p>Some people claim that Observables are asynchronous. That is not true. If you surround a function call with logs, like this:</p>
<pre>
console.log('before');
console.log(foo.call());
console.log('after');
---------------------------->
output
"before"
"Hello"
42
"after"
</pre>        

<pre>
console.log('before');
foo.subscribe(x => {{'{'}}
    console.log(x);
{{'}'}});
console.log('after');
---------------------------->
"before"
"Hello"
42
"after"
</pre> 

<p>Which proves the subscription of foo was entirely synchronous, just like a function.</p>
<p class="infoClass">Observables are able to deliver values either synchronously or asynchronously.</p>
<p>What is the difference between an Observable and a function? Observables can "return" multiple values over time, something which functions cannot. You can't do this:</p>
<pre>
function foo() {{'{'}}
    console.log('Hello');
    return 42;
    return 100; // dead code. will never happen
{{'}'}}
</pre>              
<p>Functions can only return one value. Observables, however, can do this:</p>
<pre>
import {{'{'}} Observable {{'}'}} from 'rxjs';

const foo = new Observable(subscriber => {{'{'}}
    console.log('Hello');
    subscriber.next(42);
    subscriber.next(100); // "return" another value
    subscriber.next(200); // "return" yet another
{{'}'}});
        
console.log('before');
foo.subscribe(x => {{'{'}}
    console.log(x);
{{'}'}});
console.log('after');
---------------------------->
With synchronous output:
"before"
"Hello"
42
100
200
"after"
</pre>

<p>But you can also "return" values asynchronously:</p>
<pre>
import {{'{'}} Observable {{'}'}} from 'rxjs';

const foo = new Observable(subscriber => {{'{'}}
    console.log('Hello');
    subscriber.next(42);
    subscriber.next(100);
    subscriber.next(200);
    setTimeout(() => {{'{'}}
        subscriber.next(300); // happens asynchronously
    {{'}'}}, 1000);
{{'}'}});
        
console.log('before');
foo.subscribe(x => {{'{'}}
    console.log(x);
{{'}'}});
console.log('after');
---------------------------->
"before"
"Hello"
42
100
200
"after"
300
</pre>

<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

<p>func.call() means "give me one value synchronously"</p>
<p>observable.subscribe() means "give me any amount of values, either synchronously or asynchronously"</p>
<p><b>Anatomy of an Observable</b></p>
<p>Observables are created using new Observable or a creation operator, are subscribed to with an Observer, execute to deliver next / error / complete notifications to the Observer, and their execution may be disposed. These four aspects are all encoded in an Observable instance, but some of these aspects are related to other types, like Observer and Subscription.</p>

Core Observable concerns:
<ul>
    <li>Creating Observables</li>
    <li>Subscribing to Observables</li>
    <li>Executing the Observable</li>
    <li>Disposing Observables    </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Creating Observables</b></p>
<p>The Observable constructor takes one argument: the subscribe function.</p>

<p>The following example creates an Observable to emit the string 'hi' every second to a subscriber.</p>
<pre>
import {{'{'}} Observable {{'}'}} from 'rxjs';

const observable = new Observable(function subscribe(subscriber) {{'{'}}
    const id = setInterval(() => {{'{'}}
        subscriber.next('hi')
    {{'}'}}, 1000);
{{'}'}});
</pre>

<p class="infoClass">Observables can be created with new Observable. Most commonly, 
    observables are created using creation functions, like of, from, interval, etc.</p>

<p><b>Subscribing to Observables</b></p>
<pre>
        observable.subscribe(x => console.log(x)); </pre>

<p class="infoClass">
        Subscribing to an Observable is like calling a function, providing callbacks where the data will be delivered to.
</p>        
<p>This is drastically different to event handler APIs like addEventListener / removeEventListener. With observable.subscribe, the given Observer is not registered as a listener in the Observable. The Observable does not even maintain a list of attached Observers.</p>
<p>A subscribe call is simply a way to start an "Observable execution" and deliver values or events to an Observer of that execution.</p>
<p><b>Executing Observables</b></p> 
<p>The code inside new Observable(function subscribe(subscriber) {{'{'}}...{{'}'}}) represents an "Observable execution", a lazy computation that only happens for each Observer that subscribes. The execution produces multiple values over time, either synchronously or asynchronously.</p>

<p>There are three types of values an Observable Execution can deliver:</p>
<ul>
    <li>    "Next" notification: sends a value such as a Number, a String, an Object, etc.</li>
    <li>    "Error" notification: sends a JavaScript Error or exception.</li>
    <li>    "Complete" notification: does not send a value.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Next" notifications are the most important and most common type: they represent actual data being delivered to an subscriber. "Error" and "Complete" notifications may happen only once during the Observable Execution, and there can only be either one of them.</p>
<p class="infoClass">In an Observable Execution, zero to infinite Next notifications may be delivered. If either an Error or Complete notification is delivered, then nothing else can be delivered afterwards.</p>
<p>The following is an example of an Observable execution that delivers three Next notifications, then completes:</p>
<pre>
import {{'{'}} Observable {{'}'}} from 'rxjs';
const observable = new Observable(function subscribe(subscriber) {{'{'}}
    subscriber.next(1);
    subscriber.next(2);
    subscriber.next(3);
    subscriber.complete();
{{'}'}});   
</pre>
<p>Observables strictly adhere to the Observable Contract, so the following code would not deliver the Next notification</p>
<pre>
import {{'{'}} Observable {{'}'}} from 'rxjs';

const observable = new Observable(function subscribe(subscriber) {{'{'}}
    subscriber.next(1);
    subscriber.next(2);
    subscriber.next(3);
    subscriber.complete();
    subscriber.next(4); // Is not delivered because it would violate the contract
{{'}'}});
</pre>    

<p>It is a good idea to wrap any code in subscribe with try/catch block that will deliver an Error notification if it catches an exception:</p>
<pre>
import {{'{'}} Observable {{'}'}} from 'rxjs';

const observable = new Observable(function subscribe(subscriber) {{'{'}}
    try {{'{'}}
        subscriber.next(1);
        subscriber.next(2);
        subscriber.next(3);
        subscriber.complete();
    {{'}'}} catch (err) {{'{'}}
            subscriber.error(err); // delivers an error if it caught one
    {{'}'}}
});
</pre>
<p><b>Disposing Observable Executions</b></p>
<p>Because Observable Executions may be infinite, and it's common for an Observer to want to abort execution in finite time, we need an API for canceling an execution. Since each execution is exclusive to one Observer only, once the Observer is done receiving values, it has to have a way to stop the execution, in order to avoid wasting computation power or memory resources.</p>
<p>When observable.subscribe is called, the Observer gets attached to the newly created Observable execution. This call also returns an object, the Subscription:</p>
<pre>const subscription = observable.subscribe(x => console.log(x));</pre>
<p>The Subscription represents the ongoing execution, and has a minimal API which allows you to cancel that execution. Read more about the Subscription type here. With subscription.unsubscribe() you can cancel the ongoing execution:</p>
<pre>
import {{'{'}} from {{'}'}} from 'rxjs';

const observable = from([10, 20, 30]);
const subscription = observable.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
        // Later:
subscription.unsubscribe();
</pre> 
<p class="infoClass">When you subscribe, you get back a Subscription, which represents the ongoing execution. Just call unsubscribe() to cancel the execution.</p>
<p>Each Observable must define how to dispose resources of that execution when we create the Observable using create(). You can do that by returning a custom unsubscribe function from within function subscribe().</p>
<p>For instance, this is how we clear an interval execution set with setInterval:</p>
<pre>
const observable = new Observable(function subscribe(subscriber) {{'{'}}
            // Keep track of the interval resource
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {{'}'}}
        subscriber.next('hi');
    {{'}'}}, 1000);
          
    // Provide a way of canceling and disposing the interval resource
    return function unsubscribe() {{'{'}}
        clearInterval(intervalId);
    {{'}'}};
{{'}'}});
</pre>

<p>Just like observable.subscribe resembles new Observable(function subscribe() {{'{'}}...{{'}'}}), the unsubscribe we return from subscribe is conceptually equal to subscription.unsubscribe. In fact, if we remove the ReactiveX types surrounding these concepts, we're left with rather straightforward JavaScript.</p>

<pre>
        function subscribe(subscriber) {{'{'}}
            const intervalId = setInterval(() => {{'{'}}
              subscriber.next('hi');
            {{'}'}}, 1000);
          
            return function unsubscribe() {{'{'}}
              clearInterval(intervalId);
            {{'}'}};
          {{'}'}}
          
          const unsubscribe = subscribe({{'{'}}next: (x) => console.log(x){{'}'}});
          
          // Later:
          unsubscribe(); // dispose the resources
</pre>
